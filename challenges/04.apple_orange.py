apples: integer array, distances at which each apple falls from the tree.
oranges: integer array, distances at which each orange falls from the tree.
Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of  and .
The second line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of  and .
The third line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of  and .
The fourth line contains  space-separated integers denoting the respective distances that each apple falls from point .
The fifth line contains  space-separated integers denoting the respective distances that each orange falls from point .

Constraints

Output Format

Print two integers on two different lines:

The first integer: the number of apples that fall on Sam's house.

Explanation 0

The first apple falls at position .
The second apple falls at position .
The third apple falls at position .
The first orange falls at position .
The second orange falls at position .
Only one fruit (the second apple) falls within the region between  and , so we print  as our first line of output.
Only the second orange falls within the region between  and , so we print  as our second line of output.
